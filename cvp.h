// 2. program counter (pc) of instruction
// 3. piece: Some instructions operate on values that are wider than 64 bits.

//           for pieces 0, 1, ..., n, consecutively, for the same instruction.

//           of an instruction (hence sequence number is dynamic micro-instruction number).
// 4. is_candidate: Is candidate instruction for the active track (e.g. is_load)
// 5. cache_hit: is hit in the data cache. valid only for LoadsOnlyHitMiss track

// speculativeUpdate()
//
// This function is called immediately after getPrediction() for the just-predicted instruction.
//
// A key argument to this function is "prediction_result".
// * If getPrediction() instructed the simulator to speculate, then "prediction_result" will reveal whether or not
//   the predicted value is correct, immediately after getPrediction().
//   In other words, if the contestant took the risk of speculating, he/she has the privilege of knowing the outcome of
//   speculation immediately.  This privilege is justified whether or not the prediction was correct.  If the prediction
//   was incorrect, all instructions prior to the mispredicted one will be retired before the next call to getPrediction(),
//   including draining the window of all pending calls to updatePredictor().  Effectively, architectural state becomes
//   visible after a value misprediction and before the next value prediction.
//   On the other hand, if the prediction was correct, exposing it as correct supports a speculative-update policy
//   without the need for value predictor fix-ups, for all contestants.
// * On the other hand, if getPrediction() instructed the simulator to NOT speculate, then the contestant forfeits the
//   privilege described above.  "prediction_result" will signify that the outcome of the prediction will not be
//   revealed immediately.  The contestant must wait until the non-speculative updatePredictor() function to see
//   whether or not the prediction was correct.

// getPrediction(y,z,...)/speculativeUpdate(y,z,...) calls between an instruction x's getPrediction(x)/speculativeUpdate(x) calls and
// its updatePredictor(x) call.  The delay goes away when there is a value misprediction because of the complete-squash recovery model.
